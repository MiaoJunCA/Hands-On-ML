### Main steps of making a ML project
1. Look at the big picture. Understand the target
2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for ML algorithm
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor and maintain your system

### Tricks
1. Understand the source of data, and use graph to check whether
there are problems in the data.
2. Use hash to split train/test. Set seed for random function to
makes sure get the same tests every time. stratified sampling to make
sure all classes get the same change of sampling.123
